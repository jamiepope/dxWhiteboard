[View site, hosted on Github Pages](http://jamiepope.github.io/dxWhiteboard/)

This is a working repository for the new Discovery Whiteboard Framework.

## Usage

Files can be edited on the [Github site](https://github.com/jamiepope/dxWhiteboard/), or locally. For full instructions on how to edit files locally using Jekyll, [follow the tutorial on 24 ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).

Documents are formatted in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Jekyll generates the raw files into the <i>_site</i> folder, so do no edit any of the files in here.
