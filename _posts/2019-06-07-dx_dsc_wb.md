## **Introduction**
PreSales management, along w/ an SE represntative from each region, our partner organization, and the office of the CTO met from 28 - 30 May to create a framework to facilitate more mature white board (discovery) sessions. This meeting was driven in large part from a request to certify our SE community on the whiteboard. 

Over the course of our time together we created the collateral, videoed demonstrations and came up w/ the following framework. Demonstrations were completed for the following three platform plays: `Application Development, Security, and Cloud.` Application Development and Security were driven from a `Practitioner` point of view, while Cloud was geared towards a `Line of Business Executive.` 

Our recorded demonstrations were time bound to 15 minutes per phase. We know that in some cases we will have much more time, but many times we are left at the end of an hour long meeting w/ 15 - 30 minutes to make an impact. The purpose of our time constraint was to demonstrate that following framework approach could still result in much needed discovery artifacts, and a clear path to a validation event like a workshop.

> - Identify all the technology currently used to develop and deploy the application(s)
